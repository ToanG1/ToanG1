# 👋 Hey there, I'm Toan!

I'm a Software Engineer at **Faber Company**—crafting the backend magic (mostly in Java) for SEO tools by day, and tinkering with Node.js side projects by night. I love building web apps, optimizing features, and occasionally sneaking into the world of frontend and DevOps (CI/CD, cloud stuff, you name it).

## 🛠️ What I Do
- **Backend Wizardry**: Java, Node.js, TypeScript
- **Web App Creator**: From concept to scalable reality
- **DevOps Dabbler**: CI/CD, cloud platforms, smooth deployments
- **Full Stack Sprinkles**: Not afraid of a little frontend flavor—plus DevOps, cloud, and optimization magic!

## ⚡ Projects I’m Proud Of
- [News Collector](https://github.com/ToanG1/news-collector): Aggregates and analyzes news from all over the web
- [Sprint Planning Poker Game](https://github.com/ToanG1/sprint-planning) ([live game!](https://sprint-planning.cloud/)): Make agile planning more fun and less… painful

## 😺 Outside the Terminal
- Cat and fish fan 🐱🐟
- Walking, green plants, and cooking keep me happy
- Always up for learning new things—whether it’s the latest tech, hiking, swimming, or just some random fun fact
